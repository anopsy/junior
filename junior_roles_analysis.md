 ## Junior and Intern roles analysis

## Has CHatGPT replaced Juniors and Interns?
In order to answer that question I’ll have a look at two datasets I obtained by querying the API of SourceStack - a company that aggregates job offers.
You can have a closer look at the data in the datasets_analysis.md

I’ll formulate my question into a more concrete questions, I’ll try to find an answer to:

#### 1. Did the number of  Junior and Intern roles drop significantly in 2024 as compared to 2023?
#### 2. Did the share of Junior and Intern roles within the group of IC jobs shrink in 2024 in comparison to 2023?


After answering the questions we can check if the changes or lack thereof had an impact on mean compensation and location on the jobs.


3. Did the mean compensation for Junior or Intern roles change in 2024 as compared to 2023?
4. Did the number of Junior and Intern roles change per country when we compare 2023 and 2024?
